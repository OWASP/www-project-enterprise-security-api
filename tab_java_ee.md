### Summary
<strong>Purpose:</strong> This is the Java EE language version of OWASP ESAPI. The ESAPI for Java EE is the baseline ESAPI design.

* The current release of this project is suitable for production use. It now requires Java 8 or later to use.
* The ESAPI 2.x branch supports Java 5 and above, but the releases 2.2.0.0 and later require **Java 7** or later. Note that release 2.3.0.0 was be the **last** release to support Java 7. Thereafter, Java 8 will be the minimal supported JDK.
* You may view the Javadocs here https://www.javadoc.io/doc/org.owasp.esapi/esapi/latest/index.html
* The unsupported ESAPI 1.4 branch supports Java 4 and above. Complete information on latest 1.4 branch dependencies can be found here http://owasp-esapi-java.googlecode.com/svn/trunk_doc/1.4.4/site/dependencies.html. (Google may have removed this though, so you may have to search for it on the [Internet Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/).)
* The OWASP AppSensor-ESAPI integration guide is out! See [AppSensor_GettingStarted](https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/AppSensor_GettingStarted) for details.
