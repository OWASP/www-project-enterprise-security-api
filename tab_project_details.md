## Project Details

* **ESAPI for Java**: Work for ESAPI 3.0 is still in the early planning stages and ESAPI 2.x is in maintenance / bug-fix mode (i.e., no new features will be added). Unless you are legacy project that is already using ESAPI, you are highly encouraged to read the <a href="/www-project-enterprise-security-api#div-exampletwo" onclick="location.hash='div-exampletwo'; location.reload();">"Should I Use ESAPI"</a>&nbsp;tab.
* **ESAPI for JavaScript**: Okay to use, but need to update the 'bower' dependency to a version later than 1.8.8. GitHub issue #28 has been created to try to get this resolved.
* **ESAPI for Node**: Only one outstanding issue, but no known vulnerabile dependencies.
