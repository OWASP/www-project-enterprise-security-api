## What I did with ESAPI

  - I used ESAPI for Java with Google AppEngine. I used it for simple
    validation and encoding. --[Jeff](mailto:jeff.williams@owasp.org)


  - I used ESAPI for PHP with a custom web 2.0 corporate knowledge
    management application, made up of many open source and commercial
    applications integrated to work together. I added an organization-
    and application-specific "Adapter" control to wrap calls to the
    other ESAPI controls. --[Mike](mailto:mike.boberski@owasp.org)


  - I used ESAPI for Java’s "Logger" control to make it easier for a US
    Government customer to meet C\&A requirements.
    --[Dave](mailto:dave.wichers@owasp.org)


  - I used ESAPI for Java to build a low risk web application that was
    over 250,000+ lines of code in size.
    --[Jim](mailto:jim.manico@owasp.org)


  - I used ESAPI for Java's "Authenticator" to replace a spaghetti-like
    mechanism in a legacy financial services web application. In
    hindsight I should have used the application-specific "Adapter"
    pattern mentioned by Mike above. The organization also uses the
    ESAPI Encryptor as an interface to a hardware security module.

  - I use ESAPI to be our security package for all our product, this way
    we can set one standard for all products.
    --[Yair](mailto:yairr@liveperson.com)


  - I use ESAPI for Java to educate developers about application
    security principals at several of the world’s largest organizations.
